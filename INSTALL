1. Installation

GObjectCreator uses the GNU autotools. To install extract the tarball to a directory. 
Then move to that directory and enter:

	./configure

If you want to install GObjectCreator in a non-standard directory you can call:
	
	./configure --prefix=<your_install_path>

For all available options run the configure script with the --help option.

After GObjectCreator has been configured simply type 

	make
	make install

GObjectCreator will now be installed. If you have installed to a non-standard directory 
you may have to adjust some environment variables (e.g. PATH).

To install the documentation please enter

	make install-html

This will trigger the generation of a HTML documentation for some API methods to be used in
your meta definition files. You will need doxygen for this (see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen).   

2. Running GObjectCreator

After GObjectCreator has been installed successfully you should find a script named "gobject_creator" in the "bin" subdirectory within your installation path. Make sure that <your_directory>/bin is in your PATH. To generate or update your GObject files enter:

	gobject_creator <metafile1> [<metafile2> ...]

There are several options to control the code generation. See the --help option of gobject_creator for details.

3. Syntax of Meta Definition

There is still a lack of proper documentation (tutorials, etc.). A (doxygen) generated HTML docu of the metadata API is available however. If you have installed the documentation (see above) have a look at index.html in the HTML 
docu directory.
