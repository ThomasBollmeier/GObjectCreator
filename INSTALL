1. Installation

GObjectCreator is installed with the standard python distribution utilities. Open a terminal, navigate to the GObjectCreator directory and enter:

	python setup.py install 

or 
	python setup.py install --prefix=<your_install_path>.

For all available options run the setup.py script with the --help option.

2. Running GObjectCreator

After GObjectCreator has been installed successfully you should find a script named "gobjects_create.py" in the "bin" subdirectory within your installation path. Make sure that <your_directory>/bin is in your PATH. To generate or update your GObject files enter:

	gobjects_create.py <metafile1> [<metafile2> ...]

There are several options to control the code generation. See the --help option of gobjects_create.py for details.

3. Syntax of Meta Definition

There is still a lack of proper documentation (tutorials, etc.). You might however find the doc/meta_objects.html file helpful. It contains the pydoc generated documentation of the meta objects.
